# eleventy-esm-bug-state
Snapshot of an eleventy website with what seems to be an ESM import bug. Snapshot is of a website built following the [Learn Eleventy](https://learn-eleventy.pages.dev/) tutorial up to [Lesson 8](https://learn-eleventy.pages.dev/lesson/8/).


If you remove the line:

```
type: module
```

from `package.json` and convert all `import`/`export` statements to use `commonjs` syntax, the website works fine when running `npm start`â€”so it seems this is a bug with how Eleventy handles ESM, unless I'm missing something super simple.


### Node versions
Same results with node versions `20.17`, `22.13.1`, `23.6.0`.
(managed with `nvm`).

### Errors

Reproduce by simply running `npm start`.

You should see the following error message:

```
[11ty] Eleventy Error (CLI):
[11ty] 1. Error in your Eleventy config file '.eleventy.js'. You may need to run `npm install`. (via EleventyConfigError)
[11ty] 2. Cannot find module '/eleventy-esm-bug-state/src/utils/sort-by-display-order' imported from $PROJECT_ROOT/eleventy-esm-bug-state/.eleventy.js
[11ty] Did you mean to import ../src/utils/sort-by-display-order.js?

```

If you change your import to the one recommended with "Did you mean to import" (looking at the file structure, it doesn't really make sense to), you see a similar error message:

```
[11ty] Eleventy Error (CLI):
[11ty] 1. Error in your Eleventy config file '.eleventy.js'. You may need to run `npm install`. (via EleventyConfigError)
[11ty] 2. Cannot find module '$PROJECT_ROOT/eleventy-esm-bug-state/src/utils/sort-by-display-order.js' imported from $PROJECT_ROOT/eleventy-esm-bug-state/.eleventy.js
